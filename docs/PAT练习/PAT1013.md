#  1013 Battle Over City

> It is vitally important to have all the cities connected by highways in a war. If a city is occupied by the enemy, all the highways from/toward that city are closed. We must know immediately if we need to repair any other highways to keep the rest of the cities connected. Given the map of cities which have all the remaining highways marked, you are supposed to tell the number of highways need to be repaired, quickly.
>
> For example, if we have 3 cities and 2 highways connecting *city1*-*city2* and *city1*-*city3*. Then if *city1* is occupied by the enemy, we must have 1 highway repaired, that is the highway *city2*-*city3*.
>
> ### Input Specification:
>
> Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing 3 numbers *N* (<1000), *M* and *K*, which are the total number of cities, the number of remaining highways, and the number of cities to be checked, respectively. Then *M* lines follow, each describes a highway by 2 integers, which are the numbers of the cities the highway connects. The cities are numbered from 1 to *N*. Finally there is a line containing *K* numbers, which represent the cities we concern.
>
> ### Output Specification:
>
> For each of the *K* cities, output in a line the number of highways need to be repaired if that city is lost.

## Description

删去图中的一个节点后，剩下的节点分成了多少个连通区域，这里对连通性的判断采用DFS方法。

## Solution

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

void dfs(vector<vector<int>> &paths, vector<int> &visited, int checkCity, int rootCity, int currentCity) {
    // 如果节点已被访问或被标记为题意中的不可达状态，直接返回
    if (visited[currentCity] > 0 || currentCity == checkCity) {
        return;
    }
    // 节点的访问状态设为搜索的根节点标号，表明已访问并记录连通性
    visited[currentCity] = rootCity;
    // 对当前节点相连的每个节点应用DFS
    for (int nextCity : paths[currentCity]) {
        dfs(paths, visited, checkCity, rootCity, nextCity);  
    }
}

int main() {
    int N, M, K;
    cin >> N >> M >> K;
    vector<vector<int>> paths(N + 1, vector<int>());
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        int from, to;
        cin >> from >> to;
        paths[from].push_back(to);
        paths[to].push_back(from);
    }
    vector<int> checkCities(K);
    for (int i = 0; i < K; ++i) {
        cin >> checkCities[i];
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < K; ++i) {
        // 默认值-1表示未被访问
        vector<int> visited(N + 1, -1);
        // 依次以每个节点作为DFS开始节点
        for (int start = 1; start <= N; ++start) {
            dfs(paths, visited, checkCities[i], start, start);
        }
        // 借助set去重
        set<int> visitedSet(visited.begin(), visited.end());
        // 不可访问的节点标为-1所以多计算了一块区域，且N块区域连通需要N-1路径，故-2
        int sum = visitedSet.size() - 2;
        cout << sum;
        if (i < K - 1) {
            cout << endl;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```
