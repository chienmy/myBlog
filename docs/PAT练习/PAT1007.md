#  1007 Maximum Subsequence Sum

> Given a sequence of *K* integers { *N*1, *N*2, ..., *NK* }. A continuous subsequence is defined to be { *Ni*, *Ni*+1, ..., *Nj* } where 1≤*i*≤*j*≤*K*. The Maximum Subsequence is the continuous subsequence which has the largest sum of its elements. For example, given sequence { -2, 11, -4, 13, -5, -2 }, its maximum subsequence is { 11, -4, 13 } with the largest sum being 20.
>
> Now you are supposed to find the largest sum, together with the first and the last numbers of the maximum subsequence.
>
> ### Input Specification:
>
> Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies two lines. The first line contains a positive integer *K* (≤10000). The second line contains *K* numbers, separated by a space.
>
> ### Output Specification:
>
> For each test case, output in one line the largest sum, together with the first and the last numbers of the maximum subsequence. The numbers must be separated by one space, but there must be no extra space at the end of a line. In case that the maximum subsequence is not unique, output the one with the smallest indices *i* and *j* (as shown by the sample case). If all the *K* numbers are negative, then its maximum sum is defined to be 0, and you are supposed to output the first and the last numbers of the whole sequence.

## Description

最大子序列和问题，额外需要保存子序列区间位置。

## Solution

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int K;
    cin >> K;
    int num[K];
    for (int i = 0; i < K; ++i) {
        cin >> num[i];
    }

    int sum = 0, left = 0;
    int maxSum = -1, maxLeft = 0, maxRight = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < K; ++i) {
        sum += num[i];
        // sum小于0说明这之前的子序列均不属于答案的一部分，注意此时需要更新区间端点
        if (sum < 0) {
            sum = 0;
            left = i + 1;
        } 
        // 更新最大值，保存区间端点
        else if (sum > maxSum) {
            maxSum = sum;
            maxLeft = left;
            maxRight = i;
        }
    }

    // 题目要求小于0时输出0和整个序列首尾的数
    if (maxSum < 0) {
        cout << 0 << " " << num[0] << " " << num[K - 1];
    } else {
        cout << maxSum << " " << num[maxLeft] << " " << num[maxRight];
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Review

错误：

- 审题不清，最后的输出有额外的要求
- 最大值的初始值要根据情况赋值，这里设为负数即可，不能设为0，有时要设为Integer最小值
